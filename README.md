A simple calendar control in Javascript based on Prototype.

This repo is a fork of the Scal project on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/scaljs/). The original project's [homepage](http://scal.fieldguidetoprogrammers.com/) has been down for some time now, and the last commit to the project was in 2008. However, I like Scal and use it everyday, so here it is. 

I'll be porting the wiki shortly and will add some basic usage examples to this README.
